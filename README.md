# arduino-bluetooth-car
this is a bluetooth car project from arduino
you need some components:
         *Arduino Uno
         *4 gear motors
         *adafruit motor driver shield
         *bluetooth module
         *jumper wires
         *arduino car chassis


the connections:
       *set the shield for arduino.
       *the bluetooth module:
                            .tx pin connects arduino's rx pin
                            .rx pin connects arduino's tx pin
       
       *use a extenal power source for the motor driver shield = (min = 6v)
